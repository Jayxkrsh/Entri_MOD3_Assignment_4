This project sets up a database to store information about countries and individuals. It includes two tables: one for country details, such as name, population, and area, and another for individual persons, linked to their respective countries.

The project features SQL scripts for creating the tables and inserting sample data, along with various queries to retrieve specific information. Users can easily clone the repository, run the SQL scripts in their database environment, and execute the queries to see results.
